# Asset cleanup (PASS D)

Removed unused public assets to reduce bundle size and repository clutter, including:

- Unused public icons that were no longer referenced in the application.
- Legacy fonts and font formats that were not referenced by styles or preloaders.
- Unused marketing images (app store badges, reciter photos, and take-notes imagery).
- Test media and unused worklet assets from `public/publicMin`.
